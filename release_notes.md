# Ptypy 0.3 release notes

We are happy to announce that ptypy 0.3 is now out. If you have been using the ptypy 0.2 (from the master branch), the transition should be smooth but far from automatic - see below "Breaking changes". The essence of this new release is a redesign of ptypy's internal structure, especially the introduction of an extendable [`ScanModel`](https://github.com/ptycho/ptypy/blob/master/ptypy/core/manager.py), which should make new ideas and new algorithms easier to implement, and the introduction of the [`descriptor`](https://github.com/ptycho/ptypy/blob/master/ptypy/utils/descriptor.py) submodule, which manages the whole parameter tree (including validation, defaults, and documentation).
